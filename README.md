# Challenge

This repository contains solutions for two programming tasks: `Task_1` and `Task_2`.

## Task_1: Random Line from a File

### Description
Given a very large plain text file where each line contains a plain text string, this task involves writing a program that prints an arbitrary line from the file. The solution is optimized to minimize the runtime for each additional execution by creating an index file on the first run.

## Task_2: Search

### Description

Given a sorted array of integers, the task is to find a location `j` such that all elements before `j` are strictly less than a target integer `x`, and all elements from `j` onwards are greater than or equal to `x`. The solution uses a binary search algorithm to achieve a runtime of O(log n).
